these examples rely on dot.conf being already installed
on your system.

The context and duplicate examples also rely on libpool being built, but it does not need to be installed.

to build, simply cd into the example's directory and type
$ make

for everything that remains unclear you may consult the documentation,
or contact me at    <w.d.hubbs@gmail.com>


the duplicates/ example has been provided by Joost Remijn to show what you can
do with his DUPLICATE_OPTION_NAME feature. You need at least dot.conf 1.0.9 to
use it.


enjoy.
